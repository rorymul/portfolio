Throughout my time in college, I have worked on a variety of assignments and projects that have challenged me to think critically, apply my knowledge in practical settings, and develop key problem-solving skills. These projects have spanned multiple disciplines, allowing me to gain hands-on experience, collaborate with peers, and refine my ability to research, analyse, and present findings effectively.

From individual research papers to group-based projects, each assignment has contributed to my academic and professional development. Many of these tasks required not only technical expertise but also creativity, adaptability, and strong communication skills, qualities that will be invaluable as I move forward in my career.

Below, youâ€™ll find a collection of the assignments and projects I have completed during my final year in college. Feel free to explore them to gain insight into the work I have done and the skills I have developed along the way.
