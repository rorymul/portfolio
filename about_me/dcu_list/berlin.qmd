I had the incredible honour of representing Dublin City University at the BIP Berlin Entrepreneur Bootcamp, after being selected among 14 other final-year business school studentsâ€”a distinction that filled me with pride and gratitude. This intensive, week-long program was hosted collaboratively by The Berlin School of Economics and Law, The Drivery innovation hub, and the Startup Incubator Berlin. The bootcamp united passionate students and aspiring entrepreneurs from three esteemed academic institutions: Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, The Berlin School of Economics and Law, and Dublin City University. This international collaboration provided a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere that encouraged innovation, cultural exchange, and entrepreneurial creativity.

Throughout the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with a talented, diverse, and highly motivated team of students from Finland and Germany. Together, we addressed pressing sustainability challenges faced by modern cities, exploring ways to foster meaningful and sustainable behavioural change among visitors to Berlin. Partnering directly with the sustainability-focused startup 2zero, our team developed an innovative, incentive-based reward system aimed at promoting eco-friendly practices among tourists. By combining creative problem-solving, user-centric design, and sustainable business models, we aimed to encourage tourists to choose environmentally responsible options during their visits.

As the project unfolded, I was privileged to take on the responsibility of presenting our solution to an esteemed panel of judges, mentors, and industry experts. After a competitive process, our idea was selected as the winning entry for the 2zero Sustainability Challenge. Achieving this recognition among many innovative projects validated our hard work and affirmed the potential positive impact of our solution in real-world contexts.

Although our days were filled with collaborative discussions and team projects, we also had the opportunity to immerse ourselves in the city and experience its vibrant nightlife. These moments allowed us to build strong connections and foster lasting friendships with everyone involved.

Overall, the BIP Berlin Entrepreneur Bootcamp was an unforgettable experience, equipping me with practical entrepreneurial skills, intercultural insights, and meaningful relationships that will undoubtedly serve me well in my future career. It reaffirmed my passion for entrepreneurship, sustainability, and international collaboration, marking a highlight of my academic journey.
