## Reflecting on my Time at KKR
![](images/team-kkr.jpeg){style="float: left; margin-right: 1rem; width: 40%;"}

My 15-month internship with KKRâ€™s Credit Strategies Reporting / Client Reporting Team was an experience that significantly shaped my professional growth and skill set. Coming into the role, I was initially nervous, but from day one, I was entrusted with responsibilities that made me feel like more than just an intern, I was a valued member of the team.

The experience allowed me to develop a strong analytical skillset, refine my ability to work with complex financial data, and gain exposure to the fast-paced world of Leveraged Credit. Whether it was crafting investment reports, automating data processes, or responding to investor queries, I was continuously challenged to think critically and improve operational efficiency.

I am deeply grateful to Jennifer Corbett and Diarmaid Nash for giving me the opportunity to join the team and believing in my potential. Their decision to bring me on board has played a pivotal role in shaping my career trajectory, and to Harry Knowles and Anjali Singh, whose mentorship and guidance provided me with invaluable insights into the industry and helped me navigate my role with confidence.

A defining aspect of my time at KKR was the firmâ€™s culture, which is deeply rooted in the partnership and lifelong friendship of its founders, Henry Kravis and George Roberts. From day one, I experienced a level of inclusivity, respect, and camaraderie that made my internship truly special. Whether it was team outings like watching an Ireland soccer match, one-on-one coffee chats, or even the team coming out to support me at a charity boxing match, it was the people who made this experience so memorable.
