During my time at DCU, I have had the privilege of engaging in a diverse range of experiences that have shaped both my personal and professional growth. From competing on an international stage to taking on leadership roles within society committees, these opportunities have allowed me to develop valuable skills beyond the classroom.

What made my time at DCU truly memorable was the combination of academic challenges and extracurricular involvement. Whether it was collaborating with peers on exciting projects, representing the university in competitions, or contributing to student societies, each experience has played a crucial role in broadening my perspective and enhancing my skill set.

Below, you will find a collection of the different opportunities I had the chance to be a part of. Feel free to explore and learn more about them.
