I’m a final-year business student at Dublin City University, specialising in analytics. My hands-on exposure to credit analysis and investment reporting at KKR provided real-world insight into high-level finance and client interactions. Elected by peers as their representative for three consecutive years, I’ve developed strong leadership, communication, and team-building skills.

With certifications in SQL, Python, and financial modeling, I blend analytical rigour with a people-focused approach. Upon graduation, I look forward to leveraging both my technical and interpersonal strengths in a dynamic environment within the finance industry.I’m a final-year business student at Dublin City University, specialising in analytics.
